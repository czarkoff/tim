tim - tiny image manipulator

ABOUT

The idea of a program came to me when I had to create 4:3 thumbs for a group
of different orientation images. I had to do my cropping with GIMP which isn't
so suitable for such kind of manipulations.

The program takes an image and applies a given set of filters. One of them -
cropping - is done in graphical mode.

REQUIREMENTS

 * python 2.x (http://www.python.org/)
 * Tkinter (included with python)
 * PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
 * Any graphical UI capable of Tk (X11, Windows, MacOS X etc.)
 * Mouse

CURRENT STATE

Currently the program does the very minimum it should. It lacks documentation
and several sanity checks (it may do strange things). Some more work needs to
be done.

TODO

 * Improve the Resizer UI;
 * Possibly make Resizer a normal standalone widget;
 * Possibly rewrite the program to use some modern libraries
