tim - tiny image manipulator

ABOUT

The idea of a program came to me when I had to create 4:3 thumbs for a group
of different orientation images. I had to do my cropping with GIMP which isn't
so suitable for such kind of manipulations.

The program takes an image and applies a given set of filters. One of them -
cropping - is done in graphical mode.

REQUIREMENTS

 * python 2.x (http://www.python.org/)
 * Tkinter (included with python)
 * PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
 * Any graphical UI capable of Tk (X11, Windows, MacOS X etc.)
 * Mouse

INSTALLATION

On UNIX-like system it is just as simple as:

$ chmod +x tim
$ cp tim ~/bin/tim

On Windows You should rename the file "tim" to whatever-you-like-to-call-it.py
(I would prefer "tim.py") and put it somewhere in Your PATH.

CURRENT STATE

It works and seems to be in a fairly good shape. A test on my system has given
the following results: tim is about 22% faster then ImageMagick's convert on
the same operations. While tim is no way a replacement for convert, it is
fairly useful in its scope.

DOCUMENTATION

Currently the project contains a single useful file that can be chmodded and
placed wherever one wants within the PATH, so I don't think adding a manpage
is a great idea.

Instead calling "tim" (or whatever You rename executable to) without options
will give some help. Calling "tim -h" will give more help and a usage example.

TODO

 * Rethink the CropPhoto UI;
 * Possibly make CropPhoto a normal standalone widget;
 * Possibly rewrite the program to use another imaging library.

KNOWN BUGS

 * PIL seems to be silently spoiling some images. The corresponding error
   message is shown if problem found.
