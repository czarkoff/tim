tim - tiny image manipulator

ABOUT

The idea of a program came to me when I had to create 4:3 thumbs for a group
of different orientation images. I had to do my cropping with GIMP which isn't
so suitable for such kind of manipulations.

The program takes an image and applies a given set of filters. One of them -
cropping - is done in graphical mode.

REQUIREMENTS

 * python 2.x (http://www.python.org/)
 * Tkinter (included with python)
 * PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
 * Any graphical UI capable of Tk (X11, Windows, MacOS X etc.)
 * Mouse

CURRENT STATE

Currently the program does the very minimum it should, though some UI controls
still misreact.

TODO

 * Write documentation;
 * Improve the Resizer UI;
 * Possibly make Resizer a normal standalone widget;
 * Possibly rewrite the program to use some modern libraries

KNOWN BUGS

 * When moving rectangle on canvas in crop UI the values of offsets get
   updated. But handwriting these values has no effect yet. Don't do it, or
   things will break!!!
