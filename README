tim - tiny image manipulator

ABOUT

The idea of a program came to me when I had to create 4:3 thumbs for a group
of different orientation images. I had to do my cropping with GIMP which isn't
so suitable for such kind of manipulations.

The program takes an image and applies a given set of filters. One of them -
cropping - is done in graphical mode.

REQUIREMENTS

 * python 2.x (http://www.python.org/)
 * Tkinter (included with python)
 * PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
 * Any graphical UI capable of Tk (X11, Windows, MacOS X etc.)
 * Mouse

INSTALLATION

On UNIX-like system it is just as simple as:

$ chmod +x tim
$ cp tim ~/bin/tim

On Windows You should rename the file "tim" to whatever-you-like-to-call-it.py
(I would prefer "tim.py") and put it somewhere in Your PATH.

CURRENT STATE

It works and seems to be in a fairly good shape. A test on my system has given
the following results: tim is only about 3% slower then ImageMagick's convert
on the same operations, which is fairly nice as tim ads an extra step of
rotating images according to EXIF data, providing the correctly orientated
PNGs, which convert doesn't.

DOCUMENTATION

Currently the project contains a single useful file that can be chmodded and
placed wherever one wants within the PATH, so I don't think adding a manpage
is a great idea.

Instead calling "tim" (or whatever You rename executable to) without options
will give some help. Calling "tim -h" will give more help and a usage example.

TODO

 * implement batch mode (something like "tim 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg [...] %s") to
   avoid reinitialization of python with every invokation;
 * rethink the CropPhoto UI;
 * (possibly) extend EXIF support;
 * (possibly) switch to compiled regular expressions;
 * (possibly) make CropPhoto a normal standalone widget;
 * (possibly) rewrite the program to use another imaging library (unlikely).

KNOWN BUGS

 * PIL seems to be silently spoiling some images. The corresponding error
   message is shown if problem found.
